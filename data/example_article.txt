I want to tell you about my good friend Mr. Smith. He was born Henry D. Smith in Los Angeles, CA. As a matter of fact, he was born in the same hospital as Steve Jobs, a fact which later resulted in Smith and Jobs actually becoming quite close before Steve passed away. It goes without saying that Henry got the hook up for a lot of free iPhones. I was always jealous about that; I was also always jealous about the fact that Mr. Smith always seemed to get the coolest jobs ever without ever really trying. But enough about my jealousy. Despite it, Mr. Smith and I were very close (though he would always get annoyed when I would say something like "I can't believe I'm getting the chance to meet Mr. and Mrs. Smith"). I knew facts about him that no one else did like that he loved listening to B.B. King, that his favorite book was The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and that Steve Jobs gave him his first Apple iPhone 8 years ago. The Steve Jobs was friends with someone I was so close with, crazy.
